As part of the Integrative Engineering course, the class divided into teams consisting of four/five members in order to create different full applications.
Each member had a single/couple of roles (TL, DB, Devops, Scrum Master, Automated QA engineer) and each member was also considered as a developer.
My team developed an application called iFeed for taking care of poor street animals.
